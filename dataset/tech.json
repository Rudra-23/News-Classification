Despite how earlier games in Sony Santa Monica's god-slaying epic action-adventure series have minimal narrative depth, God of War (2018) is uncharacteristically introspective for a God of War game. The title is far more emotionally mature\u00a0than the previous entries in the series and has thematic intelligence. Where the older game's prioritized epic combat encounters and large-scale boss fights, the most recent game grapples with themes of guilt, self-loathing, and redemption in an incredibly nuanced and relatable way.",

It seems to be coming from underneath the steering column or near the pedals. Car runs smooth as silk, but this sound is about to drive me crazy and seems to be getting worse and more frequent. This happens when moving and stopped, but seems worse when stopped or slowing down (but that may just be because road noise is masking it at higher speeds). Almost sounds like a Geiger counter or someone typing on a very subdued typewriter.",

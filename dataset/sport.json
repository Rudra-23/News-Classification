Expect a defensive battle. The Hawkeyes are second nationally in scoring defense (11.6 ppg), Penn State is third (12.0). The Hawks are first with 12 interceptions and will be tested by the passing combination of Sean Clifford and Jahan Dotson. The Nittany Lions are another in a line of strong run defenses the Hawks have faced, and QB Spencer Petras likely will need to make some plays downfield for Iowa to extend its win streak to 12 games.",

Yes, they're 5-0, but they have only one win of more than one possession despite playing a schedule full of unranked teams. Spencer Rattler, who came into the season as the Heisman favorite, has been playing below expectations and has fans calling for his backup. The Sooners certainly have the talent to make a playoff run, but have been lacking execution and will face their hardest test of the season on Saturday when they visit the Longhorns.",

Arum was hopping mad at Abdo for her asking for the talented former WBC heavyweight champion Wilder (42-1-1, 41 KOs) and Fury to face-off after a heated exchange during the press conference.\nThe Top Rank promoter Arum was worried that Deontay and Fury might start swinging on each other as we saw recently with Canelo Alvarez and Caleb Plant in their Los Angeles press conference.",

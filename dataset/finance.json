        "summary": "Among the largest job categories at Freddie Mac, one of the world's largest financial services companies, is technologist. That's true for many large financial companies, from credit card companies to storied investment banks. We fiercely compete with those firms for a limited pool of talent. But what if we didn't? Or at least, not so much. What if we looked to further diversify our talent pool by supplementing our selective program for attracting new college graduates in technology fields with a program that upskills mid-career professionals, including more minorities, more women and veterans from outside the technology space? That was the idea behind the creation of Freddie Mac's Fellows in Technology, End User, and Cyber (FinTEC) program.",

In addition, the experimental results demonstrate that light output power and wall plug efficiency of UV-LED with stair-like Si-doping GaN are significantly improved. Through the analysis of the experimental and simulation results, we can infer that there are two reasons for the improvement of photoelectric characteristics: reduction of dislocation density and alleviating of current crowding of UV-LEDs by introduced stair-like Si-doping GaN.",

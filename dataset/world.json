The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8% in September, the highest in two decades, while economists have predicted that it is likely to accelerate even further in the coming months. Either way it is already well above the central bank's target of 2.5%, and it is common to hear Poles grumble these days about the rising price of food, gas and utilities.",

Criminal charges have been brought in the past when a company took too long to notify federal and state officials of a spill.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal transportation investigators said the pipe was split open at a depth of about 98 feet (30 meters) and a nearly mile-long section was pulled along the sea floor, possibly by an anchor that hooked it and caused a partial tear, federal transportation investigators said.",
